# OpenDataCleaner

**(Pre-Alpha)** Opendatacleaner is a tool for importing and preprocessing dirty data, and then export the clean data to a database or a file.
An architecture based on plugins (https://mathieularose.com/plugin-architecture-in-python/) was implemented that allows the extension of the functionalities of the components.
Opendatacleaner is made up of two components, a backend implemented in python flask and the interface implemented with angular.
